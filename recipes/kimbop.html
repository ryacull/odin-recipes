    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Similar to a sushi roll, but with different ingredients catering to Korean tastes!</p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
            <li>1 Â½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>4 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 carrot, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>4 slices American processed cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>4 slices cooked ham, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Rinse rice in a strainer or colander until water runs clear. Combine rice with 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon sesame oil and salt. </li>
            <li>While rice is simmering, pour beaten eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from the skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool. </li>
            <li>Separate nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide cooled rice between them, leaving only a 1/2-inch strip seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and ham in thin layers over rice.</li>
            <li>Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and cut into 6 equal pieces. </li>
        </ol>
